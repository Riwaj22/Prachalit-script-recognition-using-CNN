# Prachalit-script-character-recognition-using-CNN

#ABSTRACT
Many manuscripts and inscriptions were written historically, spanning several centuries in 
Kathmandu valley, by the indigenous Newar people, who developed their own alphabetic 
writing system. However, digitization of these scripts have only recently been carried out, 
and many of the scripts used have fallen out in favor of modern scripts. This becomes 
problematic, especially for archaeologists, who now have to decode the manuscripts and 
store them in digital format. Thus, for recognition and transliteration of these scripts into 
English scripts, we have proposed the project "Prachalit Script Character Recognition using CNN".
